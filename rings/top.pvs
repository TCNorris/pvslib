%  This library contains results on ring theory such as the three isomorphism
%  theorems, binomial theorem, theorems on maximal, prime and principal ideals,
%  a general version for rings of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. An interesting
%  feature of this formalization of the CRT is that it doesn't require
%  commutativity holding just for rings with unity.
%  It also includes a numerical version of the Chinese Remainder Theorem (for
%  integers), which is proven parameterizing the CRT for rings.
